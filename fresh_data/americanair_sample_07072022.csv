502,2022-07-07T17:22:03.000Z,1545095814439223301,My 14yr old child is on a plane to Maui and they wouldn‚Äôt let me board bc I was got out of the bathroom and to the gate at 11:51 for a 12:05 flight @AmericanAir. I am terrified and scared. Lilly Ying was the agent that refused to let me on the plane. My daughter is scared
503,2022-07-07T17:21:15.000Z,1545095612097601536,Genuinely don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever taken a flight through @SouthwestAir or @AmericanAir that hasn‚Äôt had problems. Literally never.

505,2022-07-07T17:20:33.000Z,1545095439141281792,"@AmericanAir My flt to PUJ cxld on June 17th due to crew. There was no flights for few days and we had 1st class upgrades. We had to switch destination and pay $1,400 more to switch hotels. We complaint to AA and all they gave us was 5000 miles bonus. That's unacceptable."
